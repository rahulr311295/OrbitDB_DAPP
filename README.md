OrbitDB is a **serverless, distributed, peer-to-peer database**. OrbitDB uses [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) as its data storage and [IPFS Pubsub](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/core/commands/pubsub.go#L23) to automatically sync databases with peers. It's an eventually consistent database that uses [CRDTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type) for conflict-free database merges making OrbitDB an excellent choice for decentralized apps (dApps), blockchain applications and offline-first web applications.
